Strong Thoughts:

* Make sure there is a clear main path (searching a map and backtracking are boring)
	* You could simply restrict the level to be on direction (left to right like Mario, top to bottom like Downwell)
	* You could generate a main line path then build the level around that line path with small offshoots being obvious.


Random Thoughts:

* What if passthrough is the main/only way to move in the game?
* Maybe reset passthrough ability on contact (especially wall contact), but probably not.
