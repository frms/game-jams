Move attacking constants (spread across server and front end) to one single file/location
Only try and draw things(map) within range of the camera
Fix it so we send something to heroku every 30 second to prevent disconnect

30 key events per second (33.333 ms)

Latency:
Single client (0.5 sec delay) 35ms
Double client (0.5 sec delay) 35ms



Client: Send current player state
Server: Subtract time from new state from the time from last state (stored)
Server: Use player state and dt to calculate new position
Server: Return position and dt
Client: interpolate between last server position and new server position over dt time
