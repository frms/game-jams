Maybe the game lets you upload an image and it will use that as your avatar. And as you play the game it will change your avatar's pixels.

To Do:
Allow the finger to move a tiny amount on touch release to still count as a touch
Make sure I put a limit in the map so you can't click on tiles outside the map's bound's
Make the color player interuptable so it doesn't cause any frame skips
