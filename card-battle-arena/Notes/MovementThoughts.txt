Move to the exact point that was clicked on
	if the exact point is too close to a wall or other collider than stop when you get as close as possible
If a building is clicked on then move as close to the part of the building that was clicked on (rather than the center of the building everytime)
If a friendly unit is clicked then get as close to the unit as possible (and continue to do so even when it moves)
If an enemy unit is clicked then move to the unit until you are within attack range
Dont have units overlap

Build move to exact location (but dont go too far if it means going over a wall or player)
Build Stop when close enough to do action (attack) instead of stop X tiles away
Build Units into path finding map
