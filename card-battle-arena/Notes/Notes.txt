The objects layer on the MapData be not be necessary anymore. I can choose to treat buildings and units the same!
	If I do keep the objects layer I must make sure that the collider is the same size as the underlying tile representation (or you get a few bugs like heros walking over unwalkable tiles because smooth pathing rays are not hitting a big enough collider or players clicking on a building and instead of going to the building the hero goes a location inside the building because the tile representation is smaller than the collider)


Path smoothing is not ignoring the selection box in its raycasts. This is technically a problem but its basically not noticable so no need to fix until something becomes worse.

Consider making the map builder guarentee at least X possible paths to the bases

Green health bars for your units
Red for enemies
Blue or Yellow for the currently controlled unit

Make sure hero abilities have appropriate visual indication on how to be used. AOE outlines, cursor changes, etc
