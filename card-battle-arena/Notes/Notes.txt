Watch out for timeout repathing and target moved repathing over writing each other's work

Do I want the no progress stop following path logic to also affect paths to friendly targets, what about paths to enemies?

Consider making the timeout for no progress variable by the distance from your target that you are

Should I add some separation to grouping up units?


put in logic that will realize when the character isnt making much progress and finds a path to the next node in its current path that isnt occupied by another character (and the path finding takes into account the other characters)


if the target is within atk range then atk
	if you can get close to the target by going straight to it and not bumping into anyone then move till you can touch the target (test with double raycast to the target making sure you only hit the target)
	else stop moving

if you make contact with the target stop moving





Right now the hero to hero movement ends slightly abruptly as soon as the hero is near its target it stops moving. It would be nice if the hero acted more like it does with arrive and slows down to stop.

Other problems that have yet to be tackled
	stopping when the end location is too close to the wall
	figuring out how to make a group stop figiting when they all try and go to the same location and they cant all fit immediately on top of it
	going around someone directly on your path

The objects layer on the MapData be not be necessary anymore. I can choose to treat buildings and units the same!
	If I do keep the objects layer I must make sure that the collider is the same size as the underlying tile representation (or you get a few bugs like heros walking over unwalkable tiles because smooth pathing rays are not hitting a big enough collider or players clicking on a building and instead of going to the building the hero goes a location inside the building because the tile representation is smaller than the collider)

Consider making the map builder guarentee at least X possible paths to the bases

Green health bars for your units
Red for enemies
Blue or Yellow for the currently controlled unit

Make sure hero abilities have appropriate visual indication on how to be used. AOE outlines, cursor changes, etc
