consider splitting player into two players one out of battle one in battle

consider making the in battle player into a monobehavior

working on getting basic AI that the logic lives in the player class

consider making party members a list of Ability scripts rather than gameobjects


Battle Scene Placement bounds

x: -5 to 5
z: -3 to 3

x of -1.25 and 1.25 is prob as close as I want them together
so I could do a 4x5 grid of
	1.25 x increments starting at 1.25 to 5
	1.5 z increments starting at -3 to 3
